# Visualization Workshop Test

This is my first markdown file ever in Github.

I will include now some cool stuff to demonstrate how this markdown works.

The workshop was taught at ["Tecnológico de Monterrey"](https://tec.mx/es) Campus Estado de México.

The instructor name is ["Hector"](https://chipdelmal.github.io).
